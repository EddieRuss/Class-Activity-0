I have taken an embedded systems class and have worked on several internships involving embedded system design.  I have also taken several programing classes at UVA including CS2150, CS2110, and CS 1110.
I would like to learn more about embedded system design and how to design more complex systems.  I would also like to learn what the current "best practices" are when writing embbeded code so that in the future I can write clean and efficient code for large projects.  I am also interested in learning if there are any advanced debugging techniques that would make debugging future applications faster.
