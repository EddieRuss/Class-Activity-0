My background in embedded systems consists mostly of the Intro to Embedded Course that I took with Prof. Delong. The major project that we completed for that course was a visual acceleromteter that used a custom header board mounted on a TI MSP430. The header board contained a ring of LEDs, which we were tasked with programming to respond to the direction and tilt of the device.




My academic interests are primarly working on full stack development, as well as embedded systems. I'm hoping to be able to go beyond what I learned in my intro class, so that I might be able to work on embedded systems projects independently.
